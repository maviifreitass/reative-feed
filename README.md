# Reative Feed

This system will be a social feed service, where users can register, create publications, like and comment on posts. 

The idea is to apply the concepts of reactive programming with Kotlin and Spring WebFlux, taking advantage of the non-blocking advantages to improve the scalability of the service.

Initially, the persistence layer will use Hibernate ORM/JPA and Hibernate Validator, with a future migration to a reactive approach using Hibernate Reactive and Spring Data R2DBC.
